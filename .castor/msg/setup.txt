PROJECT SETUP COMPLETE!

We recommend adding this alias to your shell:

    alias cdc="docker compose --project-directory .castor/docker --env-file .castor/docker/.env"

After you have done it, you can quickly use "cdc" to exec into a container:

    cdc exec main php -v

To open an alpine shell into the main service, run:

    cdc exec main ash

Don't forget to run "make pr" before pushing code for a Pull Request.

Happy coding!
